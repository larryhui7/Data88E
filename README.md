# Data88E
Coursework for DATA 88E: Economic Models with Dr. Eric Van Dusen. 

## Course Description
The idea for the class is to take students through a series of exercises to motivate and illustrate key concepts in economics using empirical data and data science techniques. The class will cover concepts from Introductory Economics, Microeconomic Theory, Econometrics, Development Economics, Macroeconomics, and Public Economics. The course will give data science students a pathway to apply Python programming and data science concepts within the discipline of economics. The course will also give economics students a pathway to apply programming to reinforce fundamental concepts and to advance the level of study in upper division coursework, research, and possible thesis work.

## Course Objectives
- Examine economics concepts through real-world data using data science methods
- Showcase applications from topics in the fields of economics
- Motivate basics of econometrics from a data science perspective
- Prepare students for upper division economics coursework and research with technical skills such as LaTeX, APIs, empirical analysis, and more
