    "Why do these curves look different than the normal linear supply and demand curves in the textbook? It's because in the textbook we've made a vastly simplifying assumptions that supply and demand curves are linear in nature. This would imply that, no matter at what price, a price decrease by \\\\$1 would change the amount supplied or demanded by the same amount. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is this intuitively true? Probably not. For example, a \\\\$1 decrease from \\\\$100 is trivial compared to a \\\\$1 decrease from an original price of \\\\$2. As humans, we think about changes as proportions, and this fact should be reflected in the supply and demand curves. What this implies is that these curves should be exponential in nature: at higher prices, a larger change in price will yield the same change quantity as compared to that in lower prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your curves above should look somewhat exponential, which aligns with this intuition!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another caveat: our results show a kind of 'local' effect and may not necessarily be generalizable to all Airbnb units everywhere. Recall that from our filters in part 1, our market only describes goods that are Airbnb stays in entire homes/apartments that occurred on the weekend over during the early summer months of 2019 (pre-July).

    "As a popular alternative to hotels, Airbnb has become subject to occupancy taxes in cities around the world. These taxes are applied to short term lodgings and are typically enforced by local or state governments in the United States. Proponents of the tax argue that existing rules that apply to hotels should also be enforced for Airbnb. Opponents instead argue that these laws do not apply to services created out of excess capacity, and the tax would stifle innovation and growth in the industry<sup>2</sup>.\n",

    "The image below of an Airbnb in Boston shows guests a cost breakdown of their stay right before booking a listing, including the different taxes that comprise the \"occupancy taxes and fees\" section. You do not need to worry about what these different types of taxes mean; the main takeaway here is that the total tax of \\$44 is roughly 14.95% of the cost (including service and cleaning fees), and is paid by the guest on booking. \n",

    "Here it will not be effective to levy the tax upon the consumer. Let us take a revenue for the government approach. We can see that the post tax demand curve lies to the left of pre tax demand curve. Since both curves are relatively elastic, the quantity demanded falls a significant amount (around 4000) but if the curves for demand were inelastic, the tax revenue generated would be a lot more due to the low drop of quantity demanded. Therefore, due to the relative elastic nature of the demand curves, the area of the tax wedge is really small as the width of the rectangle is tiny which means it really isn't profitable for the government to impose a tax on short-term rentals."

By pre-processing our data we are limiting our analysis to a certain groups and removing categories such as listings that aren't entire houses or appartments, only looking at Fridays and Saturdays etc. Due to this, our studies will be useful if we are looking to study a certain aspect of renting however, it will not give us a full picture.\n",

    "b. Perhaps the choice of the log-log model is not the optimal choice for the data and consequently due to the use of the log-log model, we are assuming the price elasticity is constant which it is not just looking at the graphs. Demand could also not just be affected by the tax, other factors could have shifted the curve as well. \n",
